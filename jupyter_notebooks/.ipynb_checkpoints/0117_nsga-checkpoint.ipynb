    "# Genetic Algorithms 2 - a multiple objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not looked at our description of a more simple genetic algorithm, with a single objective, then we advise you to look at that first. The example here will assume some basic understand of genetic algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous example of a genetic algorithm, we looked at a genetic algorithm that optimised a single parameter. But what if we have two or more objectives to optimise?\n",
    "\n",
    "An example in healthcare modelling is in deciding which hospitals should provide a specialist service in order to 1) minimise travel time for patients who need an emergency hospital admission, while 2) ensuring the hospital has sufficient admissions to maintain expertise and a 24/7 service, and 3) and ensuring no hospital is over-loaded with too many admissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One option when considering multiple objectives is to combine different objectives into a single number. This requires standardising the values in some way and giving them weights for their importance. This can simplify the optimisation problem but may be sensitive to how individual objectives are weighted (if following this approach it will probably be sensible to re-run the algorithm using alternative weighting schemes).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pareto fronts\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach we will describe here takes an alternative approach and seeks to explicitly investigate the trade-off between different objectives. When one objective cannot be improved without the worsening of another objective we are on what is known as the 'Pareto front'. That is easy to visualise with two objectives, but Pareto fronts exist across any number of objectives - we are on the Pareto front when we cannot improve one objective without necessarily worsening at least one other objective (as shown by the red line in the figure below).\n",

    "## NSGA-II\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm implemented here is based on an algorithm called 'NSGA-II'. This was published by Deb et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Deb et al. (2002) A Fast and Elitist Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm: NSGA-II. IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation. 6, 182-197.*\n",
    "\n",
    "With NSGA-II we maintain a population of a given size (in the original paper that is fixed; in our implementation we define a range - the population must be larger than a minimum size, but not exceed a given maximum size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key process steps of NSGA-II are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Start with a random population of solutions (P), encoded in binary form ('chromosomes')\n",
    "2) Create a child population (Q) through crossover and mutation\n",
    "3) Combine P & Q and score for all objectives\n",
    "4) Identify the first Pareto front (F1); that is all solutions where there are no other solutions that are at least equally good in all objectives and better in at least one objective\n",
    "5) If F1 is larger than the maximum permitted solution then reduce the size of F1 by 'crowding selection' (see below).\n",
    "6) If F1 is smaller than the required population size then repeat Pareto selection (after removal of selected already selected). This new set of solutions is F2. If the total number selected solutions is greater than the permitted maximum population size then reduce the size of just the latest selection (in this case F2) so that the number of all selected solutions is equal to the maximum permitted population size.\n",
    "7) Repeat Pareto selection until the required population size is reached (and then reduce the last selected Pareto front by 'crowding selection' as required to avoid exceeding the maximum permitted population size).\n",
    "8) The selected Pareto fronts for the new population, P.\n",
    "9) Repeat from (2) for the required number of generations or until some other 'stop' criterion is reached.\n",
    "10) Perform a final Pareto selection so that the final reported population are just those on the first Pareto front.\n",
    "\n",
    "A minimum population size is required to maintain diversity of solutions. If we only selected the first Pareto front we may have a very small population which would lack the diversity required to reach good final solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This process is shown diagramtically below:"

    "## Crowding distances/selection\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are using a Pareto front to select solutions (as described here), all solutions are on the optimal front, that is in each solution there is no other solution that is at least as good in all scores, and better in at least one score. We therefore cannot rank solutions by performance. In order to select solutions, if we need to control the number of solutions we are generating we can use ‘crowding distances’. Crowding distances give a measure of closeness in performance to other solutions. The crowding distance is the average distance to its two neighbouring solutions. we will bias the selection of solutions to those with greater distances to neighbouring solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a 'tournament' method to select between two individual solutions. The crowding distances are calculated for all solutions. Two solutions are picked at random and the one with the greater crowding distance will be selected (with the unselected solution being returned back). This process is repeated until the require number of solutions have been selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example is shown below - by using crowding distances we have reduced the number of points in densley packed regions by more than in the sparsely populated areas.\n",
