We will mimic a slow function by using the Python sleep() method to make the function take on second each time it is run. Normally it would take 3 seconds to run this function 3 times, but here we will see that with dask all three calls to the function will be complete in one second (assuming you have at least a dual core, 4-thread cpu).\n",
