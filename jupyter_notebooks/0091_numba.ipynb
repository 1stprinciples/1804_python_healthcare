    "Functions written in pure Python or NumPy may be speeded up by using the numba library and using the decorator @jit before a function. This is especially useful for loops where Python will normally compile to machine code (the language the CPU understands) for each iteration of the loop. Using numba the loop is compiled into machine code just once the first time it is called.\n",
