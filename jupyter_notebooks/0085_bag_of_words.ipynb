    "# Using free text for classification - 'Bag of Words'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be times in healthcare where we would like to classify patients based on free text data we have for them. Maybe, for example, we would like to predict likely outcome based on free text clinical notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using free text requires methods known as 'Natural Language Processing'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we start with one of the simplest techniques - 'bag of words'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a 'bag of words' free text is reduced to a vector (a series of numbers) that represent the number of times a word is used in the text we are given. It is also posible to look at series of two, three or more words in case use of two or more words together helps to classify a patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic 'toy problem' used to help teach or develop methos is to try to judge whether people rates a film as 'like' or 'did not like' based on the free text they entered into a widely used internet film review database (www.imdb.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here will will use 50,000 records from IMDb to convert each review into a 'bag of words', which we will then use in a simple logistic regression machine learning model. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use raw word counts, but in this case we'll add an extra transformation called tf-idf (frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency) which adjusts values according to the number fo reviews that use the word. Words that occur across many reviews may be less discriminatory than words that occur more rarely, so tf-idf reduces the value of those words used frequently across reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will take us through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Load data from internet, and split into training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Clean data - remove non-text, convert to lower case, reduce words to their 'stems' (see below for details), and reduce common 'stop-words' (such as 'as', 'the', 'of').\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Convert cleaned reviews in word vectors ('bag of words'), and apply the tf-idf transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Train a logistic regression model on the tr-idf transformed word vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Apply the logistic regression model to our previously unseen test cases, and calculate accuracy of our model.\n"

      "I have no read the novel on which \"The Kite Runner\" is based. My wife and daughter, who did, thought the movie fell a long way short of the book, and I'm prepared to take their word for it. But, on its own, the movie is good -- not great but good. How accurately does it portray the havoc created by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan? How convincingly does it show the intolerant Taliban regime that followed? I'd rate it C+ on the first and B+ on the second. The human story, the Afghan-American who returned to the country to rescue the son of his childhood playmate, is well done but it is on this count particularly that I'm told the book was far more convincing than the movie. The most exciting part of the film, however -- the kite contests in Kabul and, later, a mini-contest in California -- cannot have been equaled by the book. I'd wager money on that.\n",
